FINITE AUTOMATA DOCUMENTATION

class FA:
	FA(file_name)
		Arguments:
			file_name - string: A string that contains the name of the input file that contains the finite automata (The file must respect the structure from "FA.IN MODEL.txt")

		Usage:
			Initializes the finite automata object with the data from file_name

	listInitialState()
		Usage:
			Prints the initial state to the console

	listFinalStates()
		Usage:
			Prints the final states to the console

	listStates()
		Usage:
			Prints all the states to the console

	listAlphabet()
		Usage:
			Prints the alphabet to the console

	listTransitions()
		Usage:
			Prints all the transitions to the console (the format being (a, x) = b, equivalent to (a, x) |- b)

	bool checkDFA(path, result)
		Arguments:
			path - string: the string that contains the sequence to be checked
			result - bool: if the function returns true, this element will be set to true if the sequence is correct, and to false otherwise

		Returns:
			Returns true if the FA is a DFA, false otherwise

		Usage:
			Checks if a sequence is accepted by the FA in case it is a DFA

MAIN MENU:
	Commands:
		1 - Prints all the states of the FA by calling listStates()

		2 - Prints the initial state of the FA by calling listStates()

		3 - Prints the list of final states of the FA by calling listFinalStates()

		4 - Prints the alphabet of the FA by calling listAlphabet()

		5 - Prints all the transitions by calling listTransitions()

		6 - Checks for DFA and, if it is, checks if a sequence is correct
			Possible results:
				Good!      - The sequence is correct
				Bad!       - The sequence is incorrect
				Not a DFA! - The FA is not a DFA
