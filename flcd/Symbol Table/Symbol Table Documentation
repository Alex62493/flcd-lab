SYMBOL_TABLE_NODE: a node for the binary search tree
                   since it's a node in a binary tree, it contains references to the left and right branches
                   it also contains the name of the identifier/constant

SymbolTable: a class containing a symbol table represented as a binary search tree
             it has two fields:
                size: the nr of elements in the symbol table
                startNode: a pointer to a SYMBOL_TABLE_NODE representing the root of the binary tree

             it contains the following public method:
                long long addElementToSymbolTable(char* name):
                    arguments: the name of an identifier/constant
                    when called, it will either:
                        add a new node to the symbol table and return it's position
                        just return the position if the element already exists in the symbol table
