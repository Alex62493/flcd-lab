Scanner Documentation:
    Fields:
        head - the head of a linked list that contains the elements for the pif (an element is consisted of a token and a position in memory);
        tail - the tail of the above mentioned linked list;
        identifierSymbolTable - a symbol table for all the identifiers;
        constantSymbolTable - a symbol table for all the constants;
        
    Methods:
        int startScanning(const std::string& filePath, const std::vector<std::string>& keywords)
            Arguments:
                IN:  filePath: string         - the (absolute/relative) path to the file that contains the code that is evaluated
                IN:  keywords: vector<string> - the list of reserved keywords used by the language
                OUT: unknownMember: string    - in case of success, this will be an empty string, otherwise it will be the token that caused an error
                
            Returns:
                0 if the scanner was runned successfully, the line where there an unknown token was found otherwise
                
            Use:
                By giving the function the path to the file that needs to be evaluated and a list of reserved keywords, it will return either return 0, in which case the code was evaluated successfully or it returns the line and the token that caused an error
                
        void printResults(const std::string& pifFileName, const std::string& identifierStFile, const std::string& constStFile)
            Arguments:
                IN: pifFileName: string      - the (absolute/relative) path where the PIF will be written
                IN: identifierStFile: string - the (absolute/relative) path where the symbol table for the identifiers will be written
                IN: constStFile: string      - the (absolute/relative) path where the symbol table for the constants will be written
                
            Returns:
                Nothing
                
            Use:
                IMPORTANT: use only after calling startScanning, otherwise the files will be empty
                This functions prints the PIF and the symbol tables to their respective files
